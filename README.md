NOTE: YOU NEED TO HAVE THE TVOUT LIBRARY INSTALLED. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM ON YOUR MACHINE


This is a potential Spectrum Audio visualizer that works by reading serial data.

This code just displays it. Like an Arduino slave :P 

The idea is that the FFT calculated line heights are transfered through serial (USB or even better BLUETOOTH!! :D)

The processing is done on the host machine. And I thought if software like cava fxp. can be modified to work with this.
  
 
 Enjoy your geek party :)
